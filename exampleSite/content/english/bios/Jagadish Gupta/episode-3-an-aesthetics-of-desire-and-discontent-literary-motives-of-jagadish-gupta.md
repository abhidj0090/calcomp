In order to estimate Jagadish Gupta’s distinct contribution to the modern Bengali literature of the first half of the twentieth century, we need to remember that Gupta was ten years younger than the doyen of Bengali fiction, Saratchandra Chattopadhyay (1876-1938), and was at least fifteen years older than the literary artists associated with the _Kallol_ movement. Though Gupta was a regular contributor to two leading literary magazines, _Kallol_ and _Kali Kalam_, he cannot be easily grouped together with the younger generation of Bengali avant-garde authors of the late-nineteen twenties, thirties and forties. Major Bengali poet and critic, Achintya Kumar Sengupta (1903-1976), once commented that in spite of being an older artist, Gupta, in his works, was characterized by the energy and angst of youth. Gupta’s literary art can be, on the other hand, compared and contrasted with realistic novels and short-stories of Saratchandra Chattopadhyay. Both these authors set their writings against the backdrop of the late-colonial Bengali countryside. But, the physical and psychological attributes of the characters in Jagadish Gupta’s fiction sharply differ from Chattopadhyay’s emotional depiction of some intrinsic humanity that refuses to be altered under acute social pressures. A completely new structure of feeling is enforced by Gupta with a radical shift in the aesthetics of Bengali modern fiction from an engagement with heart to that with body, supported by a calculative brain. Led by organic instincts and desires, and manipulated by a profit-seeking and exploitative world, down-trodden men and women in Gupta’s narrative, do not have time to pay heed to moral and ethical considerations of their choice of action.

As suggested in the earlier episodes of this series, the literary world of Gupta was shaped by the socio-economic changes during the transfer of power from the Raj to the Republic through War, Famine, Partition, riots. The haunting spirit of this entire period on the common mass find a poetic expression in Jibanananda Das’s “1946-47” (first published in 1948):

Many, it’s true, must leave in breathless haste, yet

One or two can buy up, depriving the many,

House and household goods for auction –

Or things that are not for auction.

Usury pays in the world, but not for all;

Beatific bills of exchange in the hands of one or two.

Everything, even woman, is taken away

By the demands of such lofty people of the world.

(Translated by Shirshendu Chakrabarti in _A Certain Sense: Poems by Jibanananda Das_, edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri; Sahitya Akademi, 1998).

A grossly unpromising reality of the common mass being “tattered and blinded/ By famine, riot, misery, illiteracy” – to quote another phrase from the above poem by Das – is reflected on by Gupta’s fictional narrative that focuses on the conflict between the crudely self-centered individual subjects and an equally crude destiny.

The relationship that persists between (wo)man and fate, and between (wo)man and (wo)man is the relationship of revenge. In his introduction to the collection of Gupta’s short stories, Subir Raychaudhuri thus writes: “Gupta was not much convinced by the possibilities of social transformation. However, as an artist he is fully aware of the contradictory roles of the oppressor and the oppressed. … In this society even a good person is received with suspicion by fellow beings, because one cannot survive by his/her goodness. In order to survive one requires money, wealth and power, which cannot be obtained in any honest way” (_Jagadish Guptar Galpa_, Dey’s Pub., 1977). In the tale, “_Rati o Biroti_” (“Carnal Passion and Break”), the central character Ram spends his life by searching for his lost money, and he comes to the realization that the narratives of sin and goodness serve to deceive and deprive the foolish and scared ordinary folk. In “_Urmilar Mon_” (“The Mental World of Urmila”), when a young lady becomes a widow she accepts her fate, but when the same lady hears her childhood friend has lost her child, the former enjoys the tragedy of the latter. The dark world of human psychology in Gupta’s novels and short stories establishes him as the foremost ‘Freudian’ writer of the modern Bengali fiction. In this respect, Gupta has marked similarities with Manik Bandyopadhyay. According to Manabendra Bandyopadhyay, Siddhartha of Gupta’s novel _Asadhu Siddhartha_ (_Dishonest Siddhartha_) is the first anti-hero of Bengali literature. Siddhartha is fated to live a sinned life and there are two options life offers to him: either to commit suicide or to revolt against the surrounding world. Interestingly the same kind of theme is treated by Gupta’s contemporary novelist Prabhatkumar Mukhopadhyay in his novel _Ratnadwip_ (_The Island of Gems_) only to save the character of the cheat from ethical fall. Siddhartha, on the contrary, seems to be under no obligation to be honest to the world.

Rabindranath Tagore wrote a long review of Jagadish Gupta’s another major novel, _Laghu Guru_ (_Silly and Great_), in which he objects against the affected realism of Gupta’s narrative, which, in Tagore’s view, seems to distort surrounding reality in order to create sensational effects. The characters and events treated by Gupta had not been witnessed or met by Tagore. In his own humble reply, Gupta asserted that one could easily find the members of his literary world around the township of Bolpur – so close to Tagore’s Shantiniketan! By throwing light on the uncharted and unnoticed areas of colonized experience Jagadish Gupta inaugurates a new trend of literary sensibilities in Bengali literature.
