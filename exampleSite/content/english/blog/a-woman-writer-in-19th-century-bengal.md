In _nineteenth century_ Bengal it was very hard to correlate women as poet or as a writer. At that period the image of a Bengali woman as a silenced, dependent, marginalized spending her day in housekeeping and has been cited everywhere. The reformed Bengali babu sometimes tried his best to remold his women who would be modern in outlook, but be traditional in inlook - . Her attire education and whereabouts were prescribed by bhodrolok babu who's reformist zeal was riddled with many contradictions .

That is not to say however that she didn't progress. In this quest to become modern so as to say writing gave her a space of her own. _She_ wrote sometimes in a gloomy corner of _her_ home, sometimes in the kitchen always aware of the prying and vigilant eyes of _her_ detractors. She not only expressed herself through _her_ words but those words went well beyond what _her_ male counterparts could comprehend. Poetry among other writings became _her_ medium of expression and something which _she_ was able to accommodate in her routine. We see her writing poems on a wide variety of subjects during this time. While many poems feature the acceptance of the dominant institutionalized value system (love, devotion, motherhood) which was very much imported from the Victorian culture, there were however some poetries in which _she_ challenged and criticized social evils and norms. These poems challenged prevailing ideologies or laws of widowhood, sati, female illiteracy and so on.

Her writings on social issues came to the notice of men like Dinesh Chandra Sen, e leading literacy figure of that time. In a literary journal Pradip (Asandh 1306) he remarked that

This was however not _her_ first foray into the writing space . As early as sixteenth century we find some indicators of women's concern on social issues in poems of Chandravati. She was a Bengali poet how translated and composed the Ramayan in Bengali and also composed '_Malua_' and '_Doshsho kenaram_'. Her Ramayan was from the point of view of the woman at the center of the great epic Sita and issues concerning her. We also find _her_ in early 19th century as Jogeswari a Kabiyal challenging the world of kabigan which was fiercely dominated by her male counterparts such as Bhola Moira. Some of Jogeswari's composition which have survived depict the social conditions of women at the time. The themes of her songs were mainly satires on the how the dominant sex and their authoritarian social codes suffocated _her_ and made _her_ feel almost like a lifeless object.

As the 19th century progress the Bengali bhodrolok took up the mantle of reforms. Through these reforms she was able to find a new space for her as a new individual. Though this new found individuality was not without it's contradictions as wonderfully narrated by Bankimchandra in his 'prachina ebong nabina'. Sometimes she is at a loss
