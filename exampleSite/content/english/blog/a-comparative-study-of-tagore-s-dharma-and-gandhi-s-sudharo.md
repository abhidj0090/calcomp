The eminent Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore (1861-1941), on his visit to China during 1924 delivered some very important and these lectures have been collected as _Talks in China_ (1924). Before Tagore delivered his lecture, the President of the Universities association Peking, Liang Chi Chao, gave his inaugural lecture. During this he said, 

> Both the civilization represented by India and china are hoary with ancient traditions and yet I feel that there is in them the vigor of eternal youth, which shows itself to-day in India in the two great personalities of Tagore and Gandhi.

These two eminent figures of Indian history, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869- 1948) and Rabindranath Tagore have been praised all over the world. As Chao said they really gave our country a new vision of civilization through each of their unique philosophy. Although they had differences in opinions and philosophies at times still these eminent personalities gave the manifesto which would ultimately lead towards better humanity in days to come.
