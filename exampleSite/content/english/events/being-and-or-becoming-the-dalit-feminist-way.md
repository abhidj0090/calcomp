Calcutta Comparatists 1919 presents to you the 89th online lecture of the CC1919 lecture series.  
  
We are very happy to announce that this Friday, Dr.Anandita Pan, Assistant Professor of English, IISER Bhopal has kindly agreed to join us for an invited talk.  
  
Here is the abstract of her talk - 'The question of who is/can be a Dalit feminist has prevailed from the very beginning of the Dalit feminist discourse. The issue of experiential authenticity has become a winning point for those claiming ‘Dalit women’ as the sole contenders of being Dalit feminists. Contrastingly, birth-based collective is viewed to be restrictive and ghettoized. This lecture delves into the dichotomy between identity and positionality through the Spivaking question of ‘who speaks for whom’.  
  
We cordially invite you to join us for this talk if it interests you.
