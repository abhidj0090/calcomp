Calcutta Comparatists1919 presents to you the 79th lecture of the CC1919 lecture series.

Though this is indeed a hard time for all of us and we are trying to stay calm and cope up with the situation, but for our team, Calcutta Comparatists 1919, this is also a very confusing and exhausting time. However, we have decided that we will continue our activities online and we believe that by doing intellectual practices we will be able to keep ourselves a little bit positive at this time. Here, we are with our next lecture.

Our next speaker is Prof. [Daniel Elam](https://www.facebook.com/jdelam?__cft__\[0\]=AZVjMilFw4SWxI7AHe-gH5HBhKMl-nmsv6Gl87bL4RhsL_Nu3c5exa9fECZT8B3p57Jril51Fx8DAmDT9seHo7oIaMlN3pW_OE4OQT244ofWKw&__tn__=-\]K-R). Prof. Elam has agreed to join us and deliver a lecture on 'Impossible Subjects: Comparative Literature and Anticolonial Thought'. He will be talking about comparative literature as a 'necessary and impossible' project, with reference to anticolonialism and philology in the early twentieth century. This talk will be based on his book- Impossible and Necessary. Do visit his website to learn more about his works. : www.jdelam.com
