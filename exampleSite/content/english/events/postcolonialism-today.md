Eminent Professor. Bill Ashcroft will be joining us on the 9th of December. For those of you who are unaware Prof. Bill Ashcroft is a founding exponent of post-colonial theory, co-author of _The Empire Writes Back_, which was really the first text to systematically  examine the field of post-colonial studies. He has authored multiple books some of whom have been translated into various languages making him a household & prominent name in the field of post-colonial studies.

Add the date to your calendar in case you forget. Hope to see you all.
