Calcutta Comparatists 1919 brings to you the 88th online lecture of the CC19 lecture series.

We are happy to announce that Prof. Ananya Jahanara Kabir and Monsieur Ari Gautier have kindly agreed to join us for an invited lecture at our forum. This joint session will focus on Prof. Kabir's words, " This presentation draws on our collaborative work on le thinnai Kreyol, as well as Ari Gautier’s historical fiction and Ananya Jahanara Kabir’s research on ‘Creole Indias’. The term ‘creole’ is very rarely attached to studies or descriptions of Indian culture. Going against the grain, we work to reactivate memories of ‘Creole’ through historical and literary critical investigations into creolisation as cultural process that shaped life, experience, and imagination within peninsular India. In our presentation, we will give an overview of how we do so (our methods) and why we do so (the politics and poetics of praxis), paying particular attention to the epistemological and decolonizing structure we have conceptualised, ‘the archipelago of fragments’. "

Ari Gautier is a French novelist from Pondicherry of Indo-Malagasy origin, based in Oslo. He writes historical fiction about Pondicherry’s place in the world, and works at Melahuset, Norway, an institution promoting art and culture from the Global South. Ananya Jahanara Kabir is Professor of English Literature, the Department of English, King’s College London, and winner of the Infosys Prize for the Humanities in 2018, and the Humboldt Research Prize from the Alexander van Humboldt Foundation, Germany, in 2019. She currently works on creolisation as a historical process and cultural theory, and its applicability to India.

In May 2020, they co-founded the multi-lingual online cultural platform, le thinnai kreyol, that promotes their shared vision for a plural and creolised India. Ari and Ananya research the historical basis for this vision in the transoceanic relationships that emerged through the mercantile and colonising ventures of Europeans and the mutual impact of these and anterior commercial and transcultural circulations, particularly in the Indian Ocean world. Taking inspiration from creolisation itself, they devise collaborative methodologies for the non-hierarchical dissemination of knowledge within and beyond academic audiences. Their project has been written about in print and online media, and they have been invited to present it to academic and popular audiences worldwide.
