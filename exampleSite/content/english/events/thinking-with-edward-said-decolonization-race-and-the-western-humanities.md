Prof. **Simon During** is a Professorial Fellow, School of Communications and Culture, University of Melbourne.  
A prominent name in the field of Cultural Studies, Prof. During was instrumental in establishing the Cultural Studies, Media and Communications, and Publishing programs at Melbourne. He has made contributions to the studies of post colonialism, secularism, Australian and New Zealand literatures as well as to cultural studies.
