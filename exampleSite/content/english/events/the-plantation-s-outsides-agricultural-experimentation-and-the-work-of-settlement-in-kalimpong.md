It is our pleasure to welcome you all to the 104th online lecture organised by Calcutta Comparatists 1919

This Saturday, we will have Professor Sarah Besky, Associate Professor of International and Comparative Labor & Labor Relations, Law, and History, Cornell University in our forum.

In the context of climate change in the Indian Himalayas, Besky is exploring how practices of colonial settlement shaped the regionâ€™s ecology and economy. She also asks how farmers in contemporary Kalimpong, a district of the state of West Bengal, grapple with the continued impact of colonial settlement.

The entire event will be live-streamed from our YouTube channel from 7 PM IST
