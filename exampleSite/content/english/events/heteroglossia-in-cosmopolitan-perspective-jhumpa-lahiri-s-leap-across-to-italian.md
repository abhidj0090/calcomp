Calcutta Comparatists1919 invites you to the 76th lecture of the CC1919 lecture series.

Prof. Didier Coste, Professeur Émérite de Littérature Comparée, Université Bordeaux Montaigne, Fellow of JNIAS-JNU, New Delhi, 2017 & 2018, will be speaking on " Heteroglossia in Cosmopolitan Perspective: Jhumpa Lahiri’s leap across to Italian". 

Didier Coste has taught in 9 countries across the world, specializing in Poetics, Aesthetics, Narrative Theory, and Translation Theory. A poet, novelist, translator, critic, and theorist in French, English, and Spanish, his many articles appeared in journals of France, the USA, India, Spain, and Australia and in edited collections and encyclopedias. He was awarded the Grand Prix of the Société des Gens de Lettres for Literary Translation in 1977. His best-known theory book is Narrative as Communication (Minnesota UP, 1989).

The full abstract of his upcoming talk:

 " Heteroglossia — speaking/writing in ‘another’ language—, here taken at individual scale, is often seen as a consequence of exile, forced displacement or subalternity under an alien domination. It is often indicted by nativist criticism as treason to one’s “natural,” native culture and “mother‐tongue,” as fostering self-exoticization, complicit with die-hard imperialist Orientalism, and repressively interpreted as a multiply deviant metaphoric sexuality involving exhibition, voyeurism and prostitution.

This lecture seeks to counter such views from a cosmopolitan standpoint: supported by an esthetic approach of the political unconscious, it considers _exos_ as _eros_, and the multifarious drive of literature for the language of other persons and communities as a manifestation of always dissenting desire, as an act of love (and unlove) better understood in terms of libidinal economy.

Jhumpa Lahiri’s relatively late metamorphosis into an Italophone writer is sufficiently unusual to deserve an in-depth study, whether or not we consider her as an Indian writer. After discussing some relevant terminology (heteroglossia, plurilingualism, globalism) and critical/theoretical tools, the present study aims at showing how a cosmopolitan Comparative/World literature perspective can bring to Jhumpa Lahiri’s work at large new, creative meanings and values that were offset by its naturalization as the production of a second generation Indian-American writer. It undoubtedly is, and the thematic constants as well as the recurrent settings of her short stories and novels in English were there to reinforce a sense of (semi-)autobiographical expression and conformity to what could be expected of someone with her background.

There are nevertheless other ways to approach this oeuvre. Concentrating on _Dove mi trovo_, I plan to investigate how alternative readings —as an Italian, an American and an Indian novel— cannot lead to choose or prefer one of them, or to conclude that a more or less successful hybridity is the name of the game. We must instead, counterintuitively, accept the co-necessity of each of these divergent contextualizations in a global framework. The singularity of Lahiri’s move and its exhibited performance, belongs to a “tradition of the new” shared by all contemporary literatures, doubtlessly including those labelled “Indian,” even when their novelty has little to do with a real emergence and is more similar to a cyclical return of obsolete fashions. Lahiri’s ‘strange case’ is therefore an invitation to experimentally de- and recontextualize, de- and refamiliarize as many modern “Indian” literary works as possible.

Beyond the touching and slightly enigmatic story of a one-of-a kind linguistic defector, there lies the largely unexplored possibility of using contextually incongruous critical tools on literary works of all supposed provenance, or treating nationally labelled fictions as genres, constraints or modes that present day global writers and readers are free to use and modify as they would with verse forms or the rules of the ghost story or the Bildungsroman."
