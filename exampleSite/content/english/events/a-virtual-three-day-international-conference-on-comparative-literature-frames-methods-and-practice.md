> **Shreemati Nathibai Damodar Thackersey Women’s University** Department of English and Department of Marathi in Collaboration with **Calcutta Comparatists 1919** are Organizing A Virtual Three-Day International Conference On _Comparative Literature: Frames, Methods and Practice._

### **Concept Note:**

For its linguistic polyphony and cultural syncretism, India is one of the most curious literary sites to the comparatists. Indian Literature, since its very beginning, carries imprints of thoughts from different _Parampara_ (traditions). Each Indian Literature is grounded within its own literary, historical and cultural receptions from other literary traditions. In essence, any singular Indian literature is never single but comparative by nature. Due to shared access to English and the recorded histories of colonial modernity, Indian literary traditions find more common ‘comparative’ grounds with English or European Literature than Indian literary traditions and texts.

Despite the obvious scope of comparative frameworks in reading Indian literary practices, monolingual literary scholarship in Indian literature has flourished. Comparative approaches in the Indian context continue to be mediated through English largely in the form of translations. Comparative study of Indian Literature can be done best by establishing communications among people with expertise in multiple Indian languages and English. Gradual paradigm shifts in literary studies in different literature departments in India also promotes comparative approaches though not always in the name of Comparative Literature. It often presents itself as ‘Indian Literature’, 'Indian Literature in Translation’, 'Indian Literature in English Translation', 'Literatures of the South-Asias', 'Marginal Literatures' or by introducing literary area studies, like 'North-East Indian Literature', etc. Moreover, various new approaches from social sciences also provoke comparative study of literature. The likes of Dalit Literature, Partition Literature, Literature of Migration, Minority Discourses, etc, often engage in comparative methodologies.

Comparative Literature as a discipline re-examines the established canon of literature by historicising the literary system and establishing access into the source language of the origin of the texts and translations. Dialogue with source language in a literary study is required for foregrounding a text within and outside a particular knowledge system. That can be done best with a liberal study of literature in different disciplines. By the liberal study of Literature, we do not mean relinquishing single literature disciplines but establishing an easy dialogue between multiple traditions.

In the past few decades, literary practices have undergone momentous changes to actively challenge forms of ‘reading’ literature. This has meant that literatures often do not remain in their sanitized quarters but seek dialogues with multiplicitous literary practices and disciplines. As literatures broaden, mutate and expand we probably need to revisit ways and means of ‘doing’ comparative literature. This means re-thinking terms of exchange between various literary practices, revisiting comparative frameworks, reworking methodologies of ‘reading’ comparative networks. This conference is aimed at drawing from the complex intellectual history of comparative literature studies in India to respond to the growing need for new methods, frames and practices of comparative approaches.

### **Call for Papers:**

A **300 word abstract** of papers on the proposed concept is invited from the students, scholars and teachers from different fields by **15th February 2022**. The papers for presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes followed by 5 minutes discussion. _Besides, individual presentations, we also seek proposals for special panels on Comparative Literature_. The first institutional comparative study of literature was conceptualised and introduced in India by Sir Asutosh Mookerjee in 1919 at the University of Calcutta. This conference pays homage to the pioneer of the discipline by naming a panel to discuss his idea and legacy. There will be a special panel called, _“Sir Asutosh Mookerjee Panel on Comparative Indian Language and Literature in Single Literature Discipline”_ by Calcutta Comparatists 1919. Prof. Tutun Mukherjee, taught Comparative Literature, at the University of Hyderabad and contributed a lot in the discipline from South India. Her untimely demise is observed as an immense loss to the discipline. This conference also pays homage to Prof. Mukherjee by introducing a panel on her contribution. Another special panel called _“Professor Tutun Mukherjee Memorial Panel on Comparative Literature”_ also will be there.
