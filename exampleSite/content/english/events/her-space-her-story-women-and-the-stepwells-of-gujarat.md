Calcutta Comparatists1919 invites you to the 74th lecture of the CC1919 lecture series.

Speaker: Prof. Purnima Mehta Bhatt, Professor of History, Anthropology and Interdisciplinary Studies (Emerita) at Hood College, USA. Dr. Bhatt’s current research interests focus on the historical and contemporary roles of women in Asia and Africa; global perspectives on women, power, and politics; women’s leadership in peace movements; the impact of globalization on women; and more recently, the African presence in India.

Topic: Her Space, Her Story: Women and the Stepwells of Gujarat.

It will be based on her book named " HER SPACE, HER STORY: EXPLORING THE STEPWELLS OF GUJARAT" published in 2014. This book is a fascinating, multi-disciplinary exploration of water, wells, and women’s spaces in Gujarat. Through a historical analysis and visual documentation of these distinctly female spaces, Purnima Bhatt sheds light on the relationship between women, water, architecture, and religion. Examining the artistic and aesthetic aspects of these structures, the author describes the art of the stepwells as looking beyond the patriarchal gods of classical Hinduism and celebrating the feminine principle. She also explores the idea of these wells acting as indicators of women’s changing social and economic status and challenging the stereotypes of the passivity of women. Her focus on ‘the woman factor’ aims to give voice to countless women who are forgotten and neglected by history, thereby making the invisible, visible.
