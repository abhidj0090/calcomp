Calcutta Comparatists 1919 is inviting you to the 95th online webinar of the CC19 lecture series and we are extremely happy to announce that Professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o has kindly agreed to join us for an interactive session. Though we have set a formal title for the topic, the conversation will not be limited to any one subject.

Professor Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o is a Distinguished Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of California, Irvine, Ngugi wa Thiong’o has been awarded numerous awards and honorary degrees from around the globe. He started his writing career around the time Kenya gained its independence from Britain in 1963. His first novel was published in 1964, making it the first novel in English to be published by an East African writer.

His novels include: “A Grain of Wheat", "Petals of Blood” and “Wizard of the Crow.” His memoirs and autobiographies include, “Detained: A Writer’s Prison Diary, Dreams in a Time of War” and “In the House of the Interpreter” – a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Ngũgĩ has frequently been regarded as a likely candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Ngũgĩ’s books have been translated into more than thirty languages and they continue to be the subject of books, critical monographs, and dissertations.
