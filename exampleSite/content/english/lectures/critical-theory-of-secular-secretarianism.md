Calcutta Comparatists1919 presents to you the 78th lecture of the CC1919 lecture series.

Though this is indeed a hard time for all of us and we are trying to stay calm and cope up with the situation, but for our team, Calcutta Comparatists 1919, this is also a very confusing and exhausting time. However, we have decided that we will continue our activities online and we believe that by doing intellectual practices we will be able to keep ourselves a little bit positive at this time.

Check out "Critical Theory of Secular Secretarianism" by Professor Ajay Gudavarthy. Professor Gudavarthy joined us on the 7th of May and delivered a lecture on a very important topic on Secular Sectarianism. Professor Gudavarthy has been working on this area for few years and last year he published a book entitled Secular Secretarianism. The talk was based on this very informative and important text.
