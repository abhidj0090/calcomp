Title of the Topic: ‘The World Turn’d Upside Down’: Reflections on World Literature

Abstract of the Lecture:

The argument presented here makes the claim that the format of the polemic in almost all discussions on world literature, whether for or against, embodies the Saidian dictum we all remember: that there may be a real Orient out there somewhere, but that Orientalism was not concerned with it, situated as it was within the Foucauldian understanding of discourse. Most discussions on World Literature today similarly transform the ‘real’ world into a discursive ‘World’, or rather, substitute the one for the other, and it follows that, like many books on postcolonial theory that preceded it, theorists and their interventions predominate, and there are almost no references to the literatures of the world. This is not to resurrect the old theory versus criticism debate; rather, the notion of the world as it occurs in the work of Apter, Mufti, and Cheah and the premises from within which the world is framed currently in their works is discussed. I end with a close reading of Rabindranath Tagore’s Visva Sahitya (1907), contrasting it with Goethe’s conception of Weltliteratur to show that his essay forwards a fundamentally oppositional reading of World Literature to Goethe’s, one that may, perhaps, be mined for its particularity and attention to the whole as it exists in the part.
