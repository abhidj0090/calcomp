It was our honor to host eminent Professor. Bill Ashcroft on the 13th of February for the 61st lecture of our lecture series.

Prof. Bill Ashcroft is a founding exponent of post-colonial theory, co-author of The Empire Writes Back, which was really the first text to systematically examine the field of post-colonial studies. He has authored multiple books some of whom have been translated into various languages making him a household & prominent name in the field of post-colonial studies.
