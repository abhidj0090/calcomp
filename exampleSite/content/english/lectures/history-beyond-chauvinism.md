It's been a year since some of us conceived the idea of a research forum that would bring brilliant minds together on a virtual platform. We gathered not only to discuss research work but also to open up a new arena for conversations and exchange of ideas and this is the true definition of **Calcutta Comparatists 1919.**

So after a year of having some brilliant people deliver their lectures on the platform, we now present to you the 100th lecture of the CC19 Lecture Series.

Ramachandra Guha graced us with his presence on this very significant day for the forum. Our guest needs no introduction. He is an eminent historian and a renowned author of several internationally acclaimed books and journals. Some of his pioneering works include: _The Unquiet Woods_ (University of California Press, 1989), _A Corner of a Foreign Field_ (Picador, 2002), _India after Gandhi_ (Macmillan/Ecco Press, 2007; revised edition, 2017), _Gandhi Before India_ (Knopf, 2014), and _Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World_ (Knopf, 2018).

On 27th September 2021, he spoke on "History Beyond Chauvinism." He spoke about five types of chauvinism that plagues the researcher and how to avoid them and most importantly he highlighted the importance of inter-connectedness among languages and interdisciplinarity.
