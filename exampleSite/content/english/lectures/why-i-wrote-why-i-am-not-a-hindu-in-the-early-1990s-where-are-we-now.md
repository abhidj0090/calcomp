We are happy to announce that Prof. Kancha Ilaiah Shepherd, Former Director, Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy, Maulana Azad National Urdu University, and Indian political theorist, prolific writer, and Dalit rights activist has kindly joined us for an invited lecture at our forum. This session was a very enriching one and highlighted important aspects of the contemporary politics of India.

The talk at CC1919 is based on his 1996 book, Why I Am Not a Hindu: A Sudra Critique of Hindutva philosophy, culture and political economy.
