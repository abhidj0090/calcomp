Prof. **Simon During** is a Professorial Fellow, School of Communications and Culture, University of Melbourne.  
A prominent name in the field of Cultural Studies, Prof. During was instrumental in establishing the Cultural Studies, Media and Communications, and Publishing programs at Melbourne. He has made contributions to the studies of post colonialism, secularism, Australian and New Zealand literatures as well as to cultural studies.

His books include Foucault and Literature (Routledge 1991), Patrick White (Oxford 1994), Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic (Harvard 2002), Exit Capitalism: Literary Culture, Theory, and Post-Secular Modernity (Routledge 2010), and, most recently, Against Democracy: Literary Experience in the Era of Emancipations (Fordham 2012). He is currently writing a book on the idea of the humanities.
