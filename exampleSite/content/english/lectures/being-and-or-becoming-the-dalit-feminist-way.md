Calcutta Comparatists 1919 presents to you the 89th online lecture of the CC1919 lecture series.

Here is the abstract of her talk - 'The question of who is/can be a Dalit feminist has prevailed from the very beginning of the Dalit feminist discourse. The issue of experiential authenticity has become a winning point for those claiming ‘Dalit women’ as the sole contenders of being Dalit feminists. Contrastingly, birth-based collective is viewed to be restrictive and ghettoized. This lecture delves into the dichotomy between identity and positionality through the Spivaking question of ‘who speaks for whom’.
