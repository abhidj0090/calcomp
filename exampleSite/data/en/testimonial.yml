    content: As a PhD Candidate, it is always wonderful to have opportunities like
      this, where we can share our research and our evolving ideas and get feedback
      and comments from our peers. It was wonderful to be able to Skype in across
      time zones, and give a talk in an Indian university. I think academia reinscribes
      a lot of problematic colonial relations, by keeping institutions in the "West"
      isolated from institutions in other places. I think it is important to have
      dialogues across these divides, and so presenting my work scholars in India,
      while residing in the US, felt like both an interesting and important opportunity.

    content: I believe Calcutta Comparatists to be an important initiative for interdisciplinary
      scholars. It is crucial to cultivate dialogue and exchanges between researchers
      at all stages of their careers and this group is doing this very well. I was
      approached by them to give a lecture on my historical research on material histories,
      and I had a wonderful experience delivering the talk as well as engaging in
      fruitful discussions with the organizers and attendees. I look forward to the
      future events and talks organized by Calcutta Comparatists.

    content: The Calcutta Comparatists 1919 are a group of enthusiastic students and
      research scholars who have come together during the pandemic to bring a series
      of  talks/ lectures on wide ranging topics from literature and culture studies.
      I was one such speaker and must say that the entire program was wonderfully
      organized. My best wishes to this energetic bunch of young people as they forge
      ahead.

      It has been an excellent experience to be associated with the Calcutta Comparatists 1919. This forum of sincere, talented and young scholars of literatures and humanities from universities and research institutes across the world has been recently engaged in exploring multiple intersecting trends of the
      contemporary studies in social sciences and culture. The ongoing lecture series organized by CC1919, with its very distinctive nature, is a novel and highly successful way to focus and continue dialogues on several areas of research interests in humanities. I feel myself really fortunate to be linked with the
      collective effort of this forum to interrogate and change the paradigms, and wish it every success.
